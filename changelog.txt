2/10/2021 - extended capabilities of sort class to make the project more modular. now adding new sort algorithms will be a piece of cake. 

What to work on next:
- implement a selectionsort algorithm, replacing one of the bubblesort
- implement a way of knowing when to stop the algorithms when they're both done, using the "done" field in Sort class
